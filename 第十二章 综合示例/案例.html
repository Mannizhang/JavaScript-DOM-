    <h1>Coldplay</h1>
    <p>
        Coldplay are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist and keyboardist Chris Martin and lead guitarist
        Jonny Buckland at University College London (UCL).[5] After they formed under the name Pectoralz, Guy
        Berryman joined the group as bassist and they changed their name to Starfish.[6] Will Champion joined as
        drummer and backing vocalist, completing the lineup. Creative director Phil Harvey is often referred to
        as the fifth member by the band.[7] The band renamed themselves
        "Coldplay" in 1998,[8] before recording and releasing three EPs: Safety in 1998 and Brothers & Sisters and The
        Blue
        Room in 1999. The Blue Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.[9]
